# Language / Libraries

* Python3 (backend)
  * [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) - One awesome Python web microframework. I'm the server side of the client/server relationship.
  * [Peewee](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/) - One epic Python database framework. Manages the storage and retrieval of all the cool stuff.
* HTML/CSS/Javascript (frontend)
  * [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) - The most advanced responsive front-end framework in the world. Too awesome for your eyes.
  * [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - The most used Javascript framework out there. Used here too. Funny that.
  * [jQuery Tubular](http://www.seanmccambridge.com/tubular/) - Something that puts YouTube videos as a webpage background... hello!
